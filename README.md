# Welcome to My GitHub! âœ¨

This is my very first repository on GitHub! It's a simple personal landing page to mark the beginning of my software engineering learning journey.

## About This Project

* **Purpose:** To create an initial presence on GitHub and practice basic web development and Git commands.
* **Technologies Used:**
    * HTML5 (for structure)
    * Tailwind CSS (for styling and responsiveness)

## How to View

You can view this page live on GitHub Pages (coming soon after deployment!).

## What's Next?

I'm just getting started! Expect to see more projects here as I learn and grow in software engineering. I'm excited to share my progress and contribute to the open-source community.

Thanks for visiting!
